# Swift Switch Examples

A technical demonstration of Embedded Swift running on a Nintendo Switch.

### Building the Example

1. Download and install a Swift nightly toolchain from [the Swift.org downloads page](https://www.swift.org/download/#snapshots).
2. Install `devkitPro/devkitA64` following the instructions [here](https://switchbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment).
3. Set `DEVKITPRO` in your environment to the path to the downloaded devkit (`export DEVKITPRO=/opt/devkitpro`).
4. `cd` into one of the examples and run `make`.
5. Open the compiled `.nro` file in a Nintendo Switch emulator.
